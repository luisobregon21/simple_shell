## SIMPLE SHELL üêö
Holberton's final project is designing, and writing a UNIX operating system.
This project will place your C language knowleged into practice after
3 months of learning low-level-programming.

#### Follow the steps bellow to compile.
 - `cd simple_shell`
 - `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`
 - `./shell`


### Functions
Prototypes | Description
----------- | -------------
**loop** | Start the main loop to our shell.
**_putchar** | Prints a character.
**userinput** | 

### Files
This is the list of files used to compile our shell.

* [memclean.c](https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/memclean.c)
Function to free passed arguments or any leaks.
* [main.c] (https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/main.c)
First function in our program that is executed when it begins executing,
nevertheless, it's not the first function executed.
* [strmanipulation.c] (https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/strmanipulation.c)
Function that will make the shell run seamlessly under the hood.
* [utilities.c] (https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/utilities.c)
Function helps the shell's enviroment.
* [validate.c] (https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/utilities.c)
Functions to execute and validate input strings.
* [shell.h] (https://github.com/luisobregon21/simple_shell/blob/master/shell.h)
Header file of functions where prototypes and libraries are all stored.

#### REQUIREMENTS

* Allowed editors: *vi*, *vim*, *emacs*
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with *gcc 4.8.4* using the flags *-Wall -Werror -Wextra* and *-pedantic*
* All your files should end with a new line
* A *README.md* file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the *Betty* style. It will be checked using *betty-style.pl* and *betty-doc.pl*
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks.
* All your header files should be include guarded.
* Use system calls only when you need to.


### EXAMPLES
#### Type of interractions:

##### Non-interactive
*Command*
```
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
```
*Output*
```
shell.h
```
<hr>

##### Interactive
*Command*
```
./hsh
```
Once the prompt `($)` is on display, you can type in the command line,
enter
**Ex** - `/bin/ls`

*Output*
```
files....
```
