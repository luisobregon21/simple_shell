.SH NAME
.B simple_shell - C15 Holberton's Simple Shell Project
- Simple UNIX command line interpreter.

-SH Introduction
.PP
The simple shell is an application that interacts with the your computer.
The user in the shell can run programs and also redirect the output of a file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell format "[options] [command_string | argumment]"


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This Shell is a simple UNIX command program that interprets,
reads commands, and executes them. 
Once the shell starts it will display the prompt ($) sing, and terminated
with the 'exit' command.

.SS Invocation
.PP
The Simple Shell can be processed both interactive and non-interactive mode.
It reads and executes received commands in order.

.SS Execution
.PP
The shell interprets arguments, reads the command line accordingly in a string.
The string is then tokenized into elements using the "space" delimiter and
validates the arguments of that command.
If the command is valid:
* It will display a prompt "($)" and wait for the user to type a command.
The command line always will end with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* If an executable cannot be found, it will print an error message and
display the prompt again.


.SS Path Search
.PP
To locate a command, the shell first searches if there is an executable by that name.
If it doesn't find it, it looks for builtin command by that name.

.SS Command Exit Status
.PP
Each command has an exit status that affects the behaviour of other shell
commands. A successfull exit command will be displayed as success,
and non-zero for failure, or error if indication fails.

Errors that are detected by this simple shell, such as a syntax error, will cause
the shell to exit with an error message. If the shell is not in
interactive mode, the execution of the shell file will display error.

.SS ENVIRONMENT

`PATH` The default search path for executables. See the above section Path Search.
